Brief Description of Project - The DEKMA Institute Matara is one of the largest institutes in the Matara district, with around two thousand students studying and thirty-five employees. The institute is totally reliant on a manual system for all of its activities, which has been a huge setback for the institute because it is extremely difficult to attain efficiency and dependability with a manual system.

Switching to an automated Class management system will eliminate all the current flows and increase the productivity of the institute by facilitating more features to the staff and students. The system will be used to store and retrieve critical institute records, such as student list, teachers list, administrative personnel list, class list, subject list, grading lists. The online library resource will provide books and articles to students. System can manage all the subject details and assign teachers to particular subject. All the exams can be scheduled and listed with all the details using the system and teachers can update marks for each student. Exam past papers and other related materials also can be added for students and teachers. The financial details about the instituteâ€™s income, create calculating tuition fee methods, notifies if student has permission attend the class or not details can be managed using the system. The notices about the special events, holidays, changes of classes, extra classes detail also can be managed using system.
